# Lab 1

## Text

Implement a Text widget in exercise1() displaying the phrase "Hello Flutter!".
Modify the TextStyle of the Text widget by changing its fontSize, color, and fontWeight.

## Icons

Replace the FlutterLogo in exercise2() with an Icon widget.
Choose an icon from Icons class (e.g., Icons.home) and set its size and color.

## Images

In exercise3(), use an Image widget to display a network image. You can use any image URL.
Explore how to set the width, height, and fit properties of the image (e.g., BoxFit.cover).

## Buttons

Create a TextButton in exercise4() that prints "Pressed".
Set up an onPressed function that prints a message to the console when the button is tapped.


## Columns and Containers

For exercise5(), create a Column with two children: a Container with a Text widget and another Container with an Icon.
Apply padding, margins, and decoration (like borders or color) to the Containers to see how they lay out within the Column.
