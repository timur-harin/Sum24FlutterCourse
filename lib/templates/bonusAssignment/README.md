## Develop a Cross-Platform Document Scanning Flutter Package

### Description: 
Create a Flutter package that enables document scanning functionality similar to iOS's scanner. The package should be cross-platform, compatible with both Android and iOS devices.

### Requirements:

- Camera Integration: Implement camera functionality to capture images directly within the app.
- Interactive Edges Detection: After a picture is taken, users should be able to adjust the document's corners by dragging them to the nearest corner, ensuring the document's edges are accurately captured.
- Image Processing: Apply a contrast filter to enhance the readability of the scanned document.
- Export Options: Provide users with the ability to export the processed image or copy it to the clipboard.
- Publishing: The package must be published on pub.dev with a perfect score of 160/160 points, ensuring adherence to analysis, formatting, and best practices as outlined in pub.dev's scoring system.
Deliverables:

A Flutter package published to pub.dev with full documentation.
Example app demonstrating the package's functionality.
Unit and widget tests ensuring code quality and functionality.


### Additional Notes:

Ensure the package is easy to integrate into existing and new Flutter projects.
Prioritize performance and a smooth user experience.
Follow the Flutter package development guidelines.
